# Credit_Risk_Modeling

Welcome to the GitHub repository for Credit Risk Modeling! This repository is dedicated to sharing code and resources for modeling credit risk. Detailed explanations of each step of the modeling process can be found in a series of posts on my Medium blog.

## Details

This project is documented extensively through a series of blog posts on Medium. Each post covers a specific aspect of credit risk modeling, from data preparation to feature selection. You can follow the steps and understand the reasoning behind each decision by visiting the following links:

1. **Credit Risk 1: Data Preparation and Exploratory Analysis**  
   Explore how the dataset is cleaned and prepared for modeling, and delve into initial exploratory analysis to understand the data better.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized to facilitate easy navigation and replication of the results discussed in the blog posts. Each major step in the credit risk modeling process corresponds to a separate directory containing relevant scripts and datasets.

We encourage contributions and suggestions to improve the models or propose new methods of analysis. Feel free to fork the repository, submit pull requests, or open issues to discuss potential changes or enhancements.

Thank you for visiting this repository, and we hope the resources here will assist you in your own projects related to credit risk modeling.
